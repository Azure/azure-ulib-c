# Azure uStream - Samples

## uStream Basic

This sample will create two ustreams: the first manages dynamic memory allocated in the heap and the second manages static memory (constant memory). The second ustream is then concatenated to the first and the resulting ustream is fully printed to the console. Further description of this sample can be found [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-ulib-c/blob/8c0aacd685748ae610ad9ede1aba94f3b6c43cc3/samples/ustream_basic/src/main.c#L43) in the `main.c` file.
