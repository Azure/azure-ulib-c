 *
 *  In the event that the source (provider) memory is not immediately available without a call
 *    to an external API (e.g. an HTTP connection to a blob storage provider), the flush operation
 *    will call this external API (e.g. http_response_body_get) in a loop, invoking the
 *    `flush_callback` each pass of the loop.
 *
 *  The `az_ulib_ustream_forward_flush` API will provide the consumer a pointer to the memory
 *    associated with the ustream_forward in the form of a `const uint8_t* const` buffer,
 *    to be handled in the `#az_ulib_flush_callback* flush_callback` function implemented by the
 *    consumer.
 *
 *  The `az_ulib_ustream_forward_flush` API shall meet the following minimum requirements:
 *      - The flush operation creates a `const uint8_t* const` from the `Data Source` and hands it
 *        off to the `flush_callback`
 *      - If the totality of `Data Source` is not available in the provided memory location,
 *        the API shall request the next portion of the data using the appropriate external API.
 *        This process shall be repeated in a loop until the totality of the `Data Source` has been
 *        copied.
